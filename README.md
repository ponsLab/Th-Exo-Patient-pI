## About the Dataset

    Purpose: Briefly explain the purpose of the dataset (e.g., to benchmark different control algorithms for lower-limb exoskeletons).
    Collection Methodology: Describe how the data was collected (e.g., experimental setup, participants, ambulation modes, sensors used).
    Data Size and Format: Specify the size of the dataset, the format of the data files (e.g., CSV, MAT), and any relevant data organization details.

## Data Structure
The associated dataset is available as supplemental material and can be accessed through the provided link (\url{DOI: 10.5061/dryad.70rxwdc6j}). Each participant's data is stored in a separate file, which contains tables detailing the iterations and activities performed.
Each participant performed activities described in Sec. \ref{sec:experimentalSetup} while Tab. \ref{tab:structureData} displays the features (in columns) for each file. 
Participants started the session with overground walking, followed by stairs and ramps in a randomized order. During each locomotion activity, the TR and SM conditions were tested, with their order randomized as well. Each file contains in chronological order all there activities performed by a single participant while the rest time between consecutive activities has been removed. The data was recorded and stored at 333~Hz. The columns in the header of each file contain sensor information, and the rows indicate time in seconds. Some of the information collected from the exoskeleton are: the joint position ($\bm{q}$), joint velocity ($\dot{\bm{q}}$), joint torque ($\bm{\tau}$), interaction forces ($\bm{\tau}_{int}$), stance interpolation factor ($\alpha$). The gait phase for each data point was determined using linear interpolation between heel strikes, covering a range from 0\% to 100\% of the gait cycle, with heel strikes identified from the force sensor readings. EMG information is available only for the five subjects collected at Hospital Los Madro√±os, stored in separate files with corresponding subject identifiers.
